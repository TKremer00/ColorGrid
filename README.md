# ColorGrid
This is a project to generate a grid with colors where the colors can't be the same in a 3x3 area

## How does this work?
This application use backtracking to know which color to choose next. 
Backtracking is an algorithm to find which of the options is best suitable, 
because of this you need to select atleast 6 colors. Otherwise you cannot complete the grid, and the program will stop.
